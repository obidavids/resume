<h1>About Me</h1>
<p1>I am a dedicated student, fully engaged in my academic pursuits while also cultivating a passion for music. Teaching myself to play three different instruments has been both a challenging and rewarding journey. Beyond my academic and musical endeavors, I am deeply committed to my church community. I volunteer regularly, often taking on unpaid roles to support and contribute to our church's activities and mission. This involvement not only enriches my spiritual life but also allows me to develop valuable skills in leadership and service.</p1>
